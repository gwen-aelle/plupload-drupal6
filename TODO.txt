file_resup.module:
- handle removing files
- handle preview intelligently

for some reason adding fields to other content types is broken.

upload.php:
- do something other than loading sites/default/settings.php and regex'ing around for the db password
- put an instance of this on the local media server and somehow do user authentication
- make this upload directly to amazon s3 (see example directory & search stack exchange for "plupload amazon s3")
